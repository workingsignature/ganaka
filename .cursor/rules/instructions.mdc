This project uses MantineUI along with TailwindCSS for layouts and components.
This project also uses pnpm instead of npm.
Try to avoid using "any" as much as possible. Strict typesafety is required everywhere.
Always follow existing standards when creating any part of the application. For example, if creating an API, follow standards followed by existing APIs.
Always use divs instead of Stacks and Group elements from MantineUI
